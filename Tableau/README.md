# Citi Bike Phenomenon
## 1
The amount people use Citi Bikes (number of records per month) is suprisingly highest in the summer months (that could be my southern bias and not wanting to do anything in 100+ degree weather). Also surprisingly the highest Average Trip duration was in February which suprises me with New York being very cold during the winter. I would expect the spring and fall months to have the highest avg trip duration and number of rides.

The average age of the subscribers is 30ish with a heavy majority of them being male. I kind of expected the average age to be a bit younger. There is also apparently a 115 year old user. That could be due to error or someone lying when they signed up for their account. But this does right skew the histogram
